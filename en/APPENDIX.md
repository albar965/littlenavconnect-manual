## How to report a Bug {#how-to-report-a-bug}

If something goes wrong send me _Little Navconnect_'s log file and configuration file which both can be located in the about dialog. My e-mail address is shown in the about dialog of _Little Navconnect_ as well.

Please add all steps that are neccessary to reproduce the error.

If you're concerned about privacy when sending log files: The log files will contain all paths (like your `Documents` directory) which will also include your username as a part of the path. They might also contain your computer's name IP address in your network.

In no case file names from anything else than flight simulator scenery or configuration files are included. No names or content of personal files is included in the log files.

I'd suggest to remove this information if you&#039;re concerned about it.

I strongly recommend to send the log files using a private forum message or by email and not attach them to forum posts where they are publicly visible.

## Files {#files}

Log files of _Little Navconnect_ for Windows 7/8/10 are typically stored in the directory:

`C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp`

The program keeps three log files and rotates these on each startup. So you can find up to three logs:

`abarthel-little_navconnect.log`, `abarthel-little_navconnect.log.1` and `abarthel-little_navconnect.log.2`.

All configuration files of my programs for Windows 7/8/10 are typically stored in the directory:

`C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ABarthel`

There is one configuration file for this program:

`little_navconnect.ini`: INI style configuration file. Text file.
