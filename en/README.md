# ![Little Navconnect](../images/navconnect.svg "Little Navconnect") Little Navconnect User Manual {#little-navconnect-user-manual}

**Version 1.6**

_Little Navconnect_ is a small free open source application that acts as an agent connecting Little Navmap with a flight simulator like FSX, Prepar3D and X-Plane. This allows to use Little Navmap on Linux or Mac and saves the the pain of setting up remote SimConnect links.
