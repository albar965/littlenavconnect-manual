Document Format Change
==========================

Sphinx is the future documentation generation tool for *Little Navconnect*. A change was needed
due to to regressions (e.g. dropping of PDF, format closed now and more) of
Gitbook (`#238 <https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/238>`_) which make it unusable.

This means a change from the Markdown format to the similar reStructuredText (reST) as well as a
change of the whole toolchain.

The old Markdown files can be converted to reStructuredText using `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_.
The results still have to be adapted manually, though.

The manual adaption is already completely finished for the English and German part of the manual
which can be used as templates for other languages.

The new documentation style will rollout with *Little Navconnect* 2.6.

BTW: This is a reStructuredText document.

Examples
----------

The Sphinx generated English documentation for *Little Navconnect* can be accessed here:

* `HTML <https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavconnect/develop/2.5/en/>`_
* `PDF A4 <https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavconnect/develop/2.5/littlenavconnect_book_en_a4.pdf>`_
* `PDF US Letter <https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavconnect/develop/2.5/littlenavconnect_book_en_letter.pdf>`_
* `ePUB <https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavconnect/develop/2.5/littlenavconnect_book_en.epub>`_
* `MOBI <https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavconnect/develop/2.5/littlenavconnect_book_en.mobi>`_


Why Sphinx?
-----------

#. It is an open document generator which can be run on Linux, Windows and macOS to
   create the documentation.
#. Documents contain an index for all headlines.
#. Does error checking on internal and external links.
#. reStructuredText provides more formatting features than Markdown.
#. Better search with highlighting of terms in page.
#. Much faster compilation than the now unsupported Gitbook toolchain.
#. Generated documents work correctly with anchors. Gitbook generated documentation
   often missed anchors in the middle of a page when loading them due to the
   useless smooth scroll feature.
#. Supports anchors which are needed for internal cross references and help buttons
   in *Little Navmap*.
#. Can generate ePUB format which can be converted to PDF and MOBI including working
   links and index.

Tools
----------

The following tools are needed to compile the HTML and ePUB documentation:

* `Sphinx installation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`_
* `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/>`_ and
  `Installation <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

`Calibre <https://calibre-ebook.com/download>`_ command line tools are only needed
to convert ePUB to MOBI and PDF.

Build and conversion Scripts
---------------------------------

* ``sphinx_convert.sh``: Converts all Markdown scripts to reST and stores the files
  in ``src/XX`` where ``XX`` is the used language code. Takes a list of language codes as a
  parameter. **Do not run this for the English and German branches which are already finished.**
* ``sphinx_build.sh``: Compiles only the changed ``.rst``-files.
  Takes the target format (``html`` or ``epub``) as the first and a list of language codes as
  following parameters. The results are stored in the folder ``build``.
  Run ``sphinx_build.sh html en de`` to generate  the English and German HTML documents, for example.
* ``sphinx_rebuild.sh``: Same as ``sphinx_build.sh`` but also compiles unchanged files.
* ``sphinx_rebuild_all.sh``: Compiles the HTML and ePUB documentation and converts
  ePUB to PDF and MOBI. Takes a list of language codes as a parameter. All results are stored in
  the folder ``deploy``. Needs Calibre command line tools.

Folders
---------------------------------

All except the listed folders here belong to the old Gitbook Markown documentation and will be
removed in future versions.

* ``src``: Source folder with a subfolder for each language containing the
  reST (``*.rst``) documents. All documents can be converted to the reST format using Pandoc.
  Populated using the ``sphinx_convert.sh`` script.
* ``build``: Folder for intermediate results when building the HTML and ePUB formats.
  You can find the English HTML documentation here: ``build/html/en/index.html`` after
  building, for example.
* ``src/conf.py``: `Sphinx configuration file <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html>`_.
* ``src/XX/index.rst``: Top level index file for language code ``XX``.

Files created by running the script ``sphinx_rebuild_all.sh en``:

* ``deploy/en``: HTML documentation with all unneccesary files stripped off.
* ``deploy/littlenavconnect_book_en.epub``: ePUB ebook format.
* ``deploy/littlenavconnect_book_en.mobi``: MOBI ebook format.
* ``deploy/littlenavconnect_book_en_a4.pdf``: PDF using A4 page size.
* ``deploy/littlenavconnect_book_en_letter.pdf``: PDF using US letter format.

How adjust the Pandoc converted files
-----------------------------------------------

Converted files need manual adjustments which I cannot do for all languages.
Note that some adaptions are optional.

Please install the Sphinx tools locally to test your translation. Using the tools
gives you clear error messages when compiling the manual. You can also use the online
tools linked above for quick tests.

Note that reST is dependent on indention with spaces for certain directives. You have to use
four or more spaces to define blocks.

Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tables are not converted properly. Copy the tables from the English reST files and insert your
translated texts there. I recommend to use simple tables as described in
`Tables <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#tables>`__.

Note that Sphinx is very picky about alignment in tables.

Code blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code blocks can be copied from the English manual as is. These don't need a translation.
The blocks can be found by looking for the ``.. code-block::`` directive in the
English reST files.

Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nested lists are not converted properly by Pandoc. You have to add an empty line before and after a
nested list and indent it.

Example for a corrected sub list::

   - List item 1
   - List item 2

       - Sub item 1
       - Sub item 2

   - List item 3

In some cases lists are collapsed to a single line. You can find these by looking for an
escaped star (``\*``).

Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Small inline images like toolbar icons can be left as they are converted by Pandoc.

Images with a caption can be converted, though.

Look for the text ``Image Above`` (the translated phrase) in your converted reST file
and replace it with a figure directive (``.. figure::``).

Image references are enclosed in ``|`` and refer to an image at the bottom of the file.
You have to inline these.

Example source image before conversion::

      |Little Navmap Overview|

      **Image ci-dessus:**\ *Un bref aperçu de Little Navmap v1.8.5 montrant
      les fonctions les plus importantes.*

      ... more text until bottom of file

      .. |Little Navmap Overview| image:: ../images/overview.jpg

After conversion::

   .. figure:: ../images/overview.jpg

        Un bref aperçu de Little Navmap v1.8.5 montrant
        les fonctions les plus importantes.

Note that the ``Image ci-dessus:`` (``Image above``) can be removed and bold or italic is not needed anymore.

See also
`Images <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#images>`__ and
`Figures <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure>`__.

Nested bold, italic and/or code styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nesting text styles like italic and bold is not allowed in reST. Pandoc escapes styles with an
backslash ``\`` which can be removed.

Example markdown with nested styles::

   **Bold text with *italic* text mixed.**

   *Italic text mixed with `code`.*

Example reST cleaned up::

    **Bold text with** *italic* **text mixed.**

    *Italic text mixed with* ``code`` *.*

Note the space before ``*.*``. Do **not** add a space before ``Italic`` and after ``with``.
Try the online tools if in doubt about the outcome.

References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc creates external references per default. These can (optionally) be converted to internal
references using HTML anchors.

Example in Pandoc reST converted text::

    `Tableau des résultats de recherche - Afficher le Menu Contextuel <SEARCH.html#search-result-table-view-context-menu>`__

External link replaced with an anchor::

    :ref:`search-result-table-view-context-menu`

You can also use the ``:doc:`` directive to refer to documents::

    :doc:`SEARCH`

Sphinx will use the text from the next header after an anchor or at the top of a file as link text.
