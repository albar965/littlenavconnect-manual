Start
------------

*Little Navconnect* comes with the downloaded archive of *Little Navmap* and is also added to the start menu when installing
*Little Navmap* using a Windows installation program. See the *Little Navmap* user manual for more information about installation.

``Highlighted text`` is used to denote window, menu, button, file or
directory names.

General
~~~~~~~~

*Little Navconnect* is bundled with the *Little Navmap* download. Do not try to download it separately.

*Little Navconnect* acts as an agent that connects `Little
Navmap <https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html>`__ running on a
remote computer with a flight simulator. This saves the complexity of
setting up a remote SimConnect link and also allows using *Little
Navmap* to connect remotely to the *Little Xpconnect* X-Plane plugin.

*Little Navmap* can connect to the flight simulator directly when
running on the same computer as the flight simulator therefore the
*Little Navconnect* agent is only needed for connecting to a remote
computer.

For X-Plane you need the *Little Xpconnect* plugin.


Windows Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two builds of *Little Navmap* and *Little Navconnect* for Windows available:

-  **Windows 64-bit:** For MSFS 2020, MSFS 2024 and all X-Plane versions.
-  **Windows 32-bit:** For FSX and Prepar3D.

Note that *Little Navmap* and all related programs are inter-operable across the network (*Little Navmap* and *Little Navconnect*)
as well as the X-Plane plugin (*Little Navmap*, *Little Navconnect* and *Little Xpconnect*).

You can see the Windows build type in the about dialog and in the window title bar (``64-bit`` or ``32-bit``).
