Acknowledgments
---------------

A big thank-you for all people supporting me, sending me their log
files, screen shots, ideas for improvements, friendly messages,
donations and more.

A huge Thank you! to Paul Watts for his support, for testing, tips,
links to incredible tools and for all his work on the manual.

Plenty of thanks to `Hervé Sors <http://www.aero.sors.fr>`__ for
allowing me to include his updated ``magdecl.bgl`` file with *Little
Navmap*.

A very special thank-you to Roberto S. from Switzerland for his valuable
input and also helping with his capability to find the most obscure
bugs.

Thanks to Jose from `fsAerodata <https://www.fsaerodata.com/>`__ for his
kind support.

The French translation of the program was done by Patrick JUNG alias
Patbest. Thank you!

Thanks to all beta testers for their effort, patience and ideas: Barry,
Brian, Gérard, John, Remi and Sam.

Another big Danke! to Marc from Germany for all his great ideas and
endless bug reports.

Thanks to all in the forums who patiently supported me and gave
invaluable feedback during the public beta:

`AVSIM <http://www.avsim.com>`__,
`SimOuthouse <http://www.sim-outhouse.com>`__,
`FlightX.net <http://flightx.net>`__ and
`FSDeveloper.com <http://www.fsdeveloper.com>`__.

This project and my library
`atools <https://github.com/albar965/atools>`__ would not exist without
the fabulous documentation of the BGL files in the `FSDeveloper
Wiki <http://www.fsdeveloper.com/wiki>`__. So, here a huge thank-you to
all the contributors.

Also a thank you to Ed Williams for his `Aviation
Formulary <http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm>`__.

Without the open source `Marble <https://marble.kde.org>`__ widget that
allows me to access and display all the maps I would still be busy doing
that myself for years.

No `Qt application framework <https://www.qt.io>`__ and I could not even
draw a simple button.

Let's not forget about all the services that provide us all the online
maps for free:

`Stamen Design <http://maps.stamen.com>`__,
`MapTiles <http://maptiles.xyz>`__,
`OpenTopoMap <http://www.opentopomap.org>`__ and
`CARTO <https://carto.com/>`__.

A thank-you to the `GIScience / Geoinformatics Research
Group <http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/index_en.html>`__ of
Heidelberg University for kindly giving me permission to use their map
`OpenMapSurfer <http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de>`__.

And last but not least: If there were no
`OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`__ and its thousands of
contributors none of us would have any maps at all.
